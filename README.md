MCB185 (2023 version)
=====================

## Intent ##

A lot of the software written by biologists is so poorly written, documented,
and tested, that it is frankly embarassing. In this course, you will learn how
to write, test, document, and distribute software that follows typical
bioinformatics and Unix standards.

+ Navigate Unix using a terminal and shell
+ Program in Python
+ Write your own libraries
+ Provide a standard Unix CLI for your program
+ Input typical file types (e.g. FASTA, GFF, CSV, etc)
+ Output typical file types (e.g. FASTA, TSV, JSON, etc)
+ Manage documents with Git
+ Distribute software with GitHub
+ Document using Markdown
+ and more...

## Experience, Aptitude, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. Your grade will be determined as much by your journey as
your destination.

## Programming Progression ##

Your development as a programmer will not be linear. Some concepts will be easy
and others will be hard. In order to become a high level programmer, you need
to understand about 100 concepts. Each of these concepts will make you pause
for between 1 minute and forever (seriously, I know programmers who still don't
understand pointers). How long you get stuck is partly up to you. You might not
be able to get to the next level of understanding by yourself. The solution is
to **ask for help**. If you find yourself stuck for more than 30 minutes, stop
banging your head against a wall and ask someone for help! Every time you ask
someone for help, two people win.

Programming *should* be done in pairs or small groups. Unlike most of your
other classes, there is no penalty for working with another student. In fact,
you're encouraged to do so. That's how software gets written in the real world.

## Resist ##

Resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did the next time.
Copy-paste is one of the greatest sources of programming errors.

There will be times you get stuck and decide to search Stack Overflow or some
other generally useful site. Resist this temptation. All of the programming
problems can be solved with the information in the tutorials. Every time you
look something up instead of thinking for yourself, brain cells die.

## Tabs ##

In this course, you must use tabs for left-side indentation. No spaces are
allowed on the left (but you should use them to align text on the right). Your
editor may be set up to insert 2 or 4 spaces instead of tabs. Turn that off.
Any program submitted with spaces instead of tabs doesn't count as being
submitted.

Why is this a rule?

+ I'm tired of debugging students' indentation errors
+ Helps discourage copy-paste from Internet sources
+ Tabs rule, spaces drool
