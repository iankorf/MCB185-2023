MCB185 (2023 version)
=====================

## Intent ##

A lot of the software written by biologists is so poorly written, documented,
and tested, that it is frankly embarrassing. The reason for this is that nobody
told them there was a right way to do things. In this course, you will learn
how to write software that you won't be ashamed to distribute.

## Experience, Aptitude, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. Your grade will be determined more by your journey than
your destination. How exactly does that work? Please focus on the journey, not
the destination.

## Programming Progression ##

Your development as a programmer will not be linear. Some concepts will be easy
and others will be hard. In order to become a high level programmer, you need
to understand about 100 new concepts. Each of these concepts will make you
pause for between 1 minute and forever (seriously, I know programmers who still
don't understand pointer arithmetic - incidentally, not part of this course).
How long you get stuck is partly up to you. You might not be able to get to the
next level of understanding by yourself. The solution is to **ask for help**.
If you find yourself stuck for more than 30 minutes, stop banging your head
against a wall and ask someone for help! Every time you ask for help, at least
two people win.

Unlike most of your other classes, there is no penalty for working with another
student. In fact, you're encouraged to do so. Programming *should* be done in
pairs or small groups. That's how software gets written in the real world, so
that's how you should do it in class. How does that affect your grade? What
part of *focus on the journey* did you not understand?

## No Shortcuts ##

This is foremost a course about *how* to program. When faced with a homework
problem, such as "compute the descriptive statistics for a set of numbers", you
could very easily `import statistics` instead of writing the code yourself. In
a professional setting, you *should* do that. However, the goal here isn't to
solve a problem but to learn how to solve a problem. For this reason, it's
important for you to write your own code. Even when you work in a small group,
everyone should write their own code.

Resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did later.
Copy-paste is one of the worst ways to learn how to program. Also, copy-paste
is one of the greatest sources of silent programming errors. No copy-paste!

There will be times you get stuck and decide to search Stack Overflow or some
other generally useful site. Resist this temptation. All of the programming
problems can be solved with the information in the tutorials. Every time you
Google something instead of thinking for yourself or asking for help, brain
cells die.

In this course, you are not allowed to use any library that hasn't been
previously introduced in this course. Since numpy and pandas are never
introduced, you are not allowed to use them.

## Tabs Mandatory ##

In this course, you must use tabs for left-side indentation. No spaces are
allowed on the left (but you should use them to align text on the right). Your
editor may be set up to insert 2 or 4 spaces instead of tabs. Turn that off.
Programs with spaces on the left get an automatic F.

Why is this a rule?

+ Helps discourage copy-paste from Internet sources
+ Indentation errors are annoying
+ The reasons for using spaces are not very convincing

## Getting Started ##

Start with the `README.md` in Unit0 and work your way up to Unit9. What if you
don't get all the way to Unit9? FFS journey, not destination.

+ Unit 0: Tools of the Trade
+ Unit 1: Basic Unix
+ Unit 2: Beginning Python
+ Unit 3: Tuples and Lists
+ Unit 4: Functions
+ Unit 5: Files, CLI, I/O
+ Unit 6: Dictionaries
+ Unit 7: Regex
+ Unit 8:
+ Unit 9: Final Project

## Getting Help ##

Asking questions in the Discord channel will get you the fastest response. The
instructor and TA monitor the course Discord server. You may get answers from
other students even sooner. Email will also work.
