MCB185 (2023 version)
=====================

## Intent ##

A lot of the software written by biologists is so poorly written, documented,
and tested, that it is frankly embarrassing. The reason for this is that nobody
told them there was a right way to do things. In this course, you will learn
how to write software that you won't be ashamed to distribute.

## Experience, Aptitude, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. Your grade will be determined more by your journey than
your destination. How exactly does that work? Please focus on the journey, not
the destination.

To give the instructors a better idea about the make-up of the class, there is
an `ASSESSMENTS.md` file with a bunch of questions in 3 categories: molecular
biology, programming, and bioinformatics. Since this is a class designed for
biologists, you should have a decent score in molecular biology, but if you
don't you'll just have to look some things up. If you score high in
bioinformatics, that's great, but not necessary. Scoring high in the
programming category may mean the class will be too easy for you. If this is
the case, you can move faster through the material and do a more interesting
final project.

## Programming Progression ##

Your development as a programmer will not be linear. Some concepts will be easy
and others will be hard. In order to become a high level programmer, you need
to understand about 100 new concepts. Each of these concepts will make you
pause for between 1 minute and forever (seriously, I know programmers who still
don't understand pointer arithmetic - incidentally, not part of this course).
How long you get stuck is partly up to you. You might not be able to get to the
next level of understanding by yourself. The solution is to **ask for help**.
If you find yourself stuck for more than 30 minutes, stop banging your head
against a wall and ask someone for help! Every time you ask for help, at least
two people win.

Unlike most of your other classes, there is no penalty for working with another
student. In fact, you're encouraged to do so. Programming *should* be done in
pairs or small groups. That's how software gets written in the real world, so
that's how you should do it in class. How does that affect your grade? What
part of *focus on the journey* did you not understand?

## No Shortcuts ##

This is foremost a course about *how* to program. When faced with a homework
problem, such as "compute the descriptive statistics for a set of numbers", you
could very easily `import statistics` instead of writing the code yourself. In
a professional setting, you *should* do that. However, the goal here isn't to
solve a problem but to learn *how* to solve a problem. For this reason, it's
important for you to write your own code. Even when you work in a small group,
everyone should write their own code.

Resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did later.
Copy-paste is one of the worst ways to learn how to program. Also, copy-paste
is one of the greatest sources of silent programming errors. No copy-paste!

There will be times you get stuck and decide to search Stack Overflow or some
other generally useful site. Resist this temptation. All of the programming
problems can be solved with the information in the tutorials. If you get stuck,
ask a classmate or instructor for help. Every time you Google something instead
of thinking for yourself or asking for help, brain cells die.

In this course, you are not allowed to use any concept unless it has been
introduced in a previous or current unit. You already know how to use
dictionaries? Good for you, but you aren't allowed to use them until Unit 6.
Want to use numpy or pandas? Sorry, we don't use those in this course. The
`REFERENCE.md` file has a chronological description of Python concepts.

## Style ##

In this course, you must use tabs for left-side indentation. No spaces are
allowed on the left (but you should use them to align text on the right). Your
editor may be set up to insert 2 or 4 spaces instead of tabs. Turn that off.

Why is this a rule?

+ Helps discourage copy-paste from Internet sources
+ Indentation errors are annoying
+ Sometimes in life you have to follow arbitrary rules
+ The reasons for using spaces are not very convincing

There is a historic convention that source code lines shouldn't be longer than
80 characters. We follow the 80-column rule in this course (most of the time).

## Getting Started ##

Start with the `README.md` in Unit 0 and work your way up. What if you don't
get all the way to the end? FFS journey, not destination.

+ Unit 0: Tools of the Trade
+ Unit 1: Basic Unix
+ Unit 2: Beginning Python
+ Unit 3: Tuples and Lists
+ Unit 4: Functions and Files
+ Unit 5: Advanced Linux
+ Unit 6: Dictionaries and Regex
+ Unit 7: Complex Data Structures
+ Unit 8: Final Projects

## Getting Good ##

One of the best ways to practice programming is to write the same program over
and over. We call this a ground-zero re-write. Practice is just as important in
programming as it is in something like music or sports. Doing a ground-zero
re-write of your homework exercises will make you a much better programmer.

## Getting Help ##

The instructor and TA monitor the course Discord server, so asking questions in
the #mcb185 Discord channel will get you the fastest response. You may get
answers from other students even sooner. Email will also work.

## Rules ##

It's worth re-stating some rules of the course.

+ No programming constructs more advanced than the current unit
+ No importing libraries unless they have been previously introduced
+ Use tabs for left-side indentation only
+ Follow the 80-column rule
+ No penalty for working with other students
