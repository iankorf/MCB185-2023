Unit 4: Functions & Files
=========================

## Learning Objectives ##

+ Methods - learn about method syntax
+ Tuples - immutable containers
+ Lists - mutable containers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tutorials ##

Each of the files in the Tutorials directory is a Python program most of the
code contained in a giant triple-quoted string. To "play" the tutorial, move
the triple quotes farther down the file and run the program again. Each time
you move the quotes, you will see new output. People who just read the tutorial
don't learn the information very well. Experiment by changing some of the lines
and see what happens.

## Programs ##

The files in the Programs directory are your homework problems. Copy them to
your homework repo and edit them there.
