Unit 4: Functions & Files
=========================

## Outline ##

+ Create your own functions
+ Open files for reading and writing
+ Use generator functions to save memory
+ Use named parameters with default values
+ Create your own function libraries

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tutorials ##

Each of the files in the Tutorials directory is a Python program where most of
the code is contained in a giant triple-quoted string. To "play" the tutorial,
move the triple quotes farther down the file and run the program again.

## Programs ##

The files in the Programs directory are your homework problems. Copy them to
your homework repo and edit them there.
