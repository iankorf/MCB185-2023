## Tutorials ##

Each of the files in the Tutorials directory is a Python program most of the 
code contained in a giant triple-quoted string. To "play" the tutorial, move 
the triple quotes farther down the file and run the program again. Each time 
you move the quotes, you will see new output. People who just read the tutorial 
don't learn the information very well. Experiment by changing some of the lines 
and see what happens.

## Programs ##

The files in the Programs directory are your homework problems. The comments 
describe the goal of the program, and the triple quoted string at the end shows 
the expected output.

While you are welcome to edit the files in this repo, we are not collaborators 
on this repository and you cannot "push" them back to GitHub. In order to turn 
your homework in, you must copy the files to your homework repo and push them 
from there.
