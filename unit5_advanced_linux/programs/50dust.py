# 50dust.py

# Write a better version of your 42dust.py program
# Your program must have the following properties

# 1. works with multi-fasta files
# 2. takes named files or stdin as input
# 3. has option and default parameter for window size
# 4. has option and default parameter for entropy threshold
# 5. has a switch for N-based or lowercase masking
# 6. works as an executable

# Hint: use the mcb185.read_fasta() function
# Hint: use argparse

# Optional: benchmark your program with different window sizes using time
# Optional: make the algorithm faster (see 29gcwin.py for inspiration)
# Optional: benchmark differences in algorithms
