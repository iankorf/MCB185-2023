# 32xcoverage.py

# Write a program that simulates a shotgun resequencing project
# Generate reads randomly over a genome
# How uniformly do the reads "pile up" on a chromosome?
# How much of that depends on sequencing depth?

# Report min, max, and average coverage
# Make variables for genome size, read number, read length
# Input values from the command line
