# 31entropy.py

# Write a Shannon entropy calculator: H = -sum(pi * log(pi))
# The values should come from the command line
# E.g. python3 entropy.py 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1
# Make sure the command line values are actually numbers
# Make sure the probabilities sum to 1.0
# Put the probabilities into a new list before doing the computation
