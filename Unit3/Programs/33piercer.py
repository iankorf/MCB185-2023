# 33piercer.py

# D&D themed problem...

# If you have the "Piercer" feat, you may re-roll a damage die. You must 
# take the new roll regardless if it was lower than the previous roll. Assume 
# you have a weapon that does 1d8 damage. Clearly, you should re-roll any die 
# with an initial roll of 1 damage. But what about higher rolls? Your friend 
# Jorg re-rolls 1-6. But Gastin says that's too high and re-rolls 1-3.
# What is the optimal strategy?
