Unit 3: Practice, practice, practice
====================================

## Learning Objectives ##

+ Practice using loops and conditionals

There are no tutorials this time, just lots more practice with loops and
conditionals. Your homework problems are in the Programs directory (as always).

Some of these programs are inspired from Dungeons & Dragons 5e rules.
