# 71gff.py

# Write a program that converts genes in gff into JSON
# Use the minaturized version of the C. elegans genome (included) this time
# Organize the genes onto chromosomes
# Print the number of genes on each chromosome to stderr
# Your code should mimic the output below

# Hint: your outer data structure is a dictionary

# Note: gene names are stored differently here than the last file
