Unit 7: Complex Data Structures
===============================

## Outline ##

+ Matrices: lists of lists
+ Records: lists of dictionaries
+ JSON and arbitrarily complex data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tutorials ##

Each of the files in the Tutorials directory is a Python program where most of
the code is contained in a giant triple-quoted string. To "play" the tutorial,
move the triple quotes farther down the file and run the program again.

## Programs ##

The files in the Programs directory are your homework problems. Copy them to
your homework repo and edit them there.
