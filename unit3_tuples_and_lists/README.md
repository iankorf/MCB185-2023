## Tutorials ##

Each of the files in the Tutorials directory is a Python program most of the
code contained in a giant triple-quoted string. To "play" the tutorial, move
the triple quotes farther down the file and run the program again.

## Programs ##

The files in the Programs directory are your homework problems. Copy them to
your homework repo and edit them there.
