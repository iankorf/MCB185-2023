# You may have heard of the 'birthday paradox' before
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem
# Let's try simulating it

# You will need a list for the 365 day calendar
# You will need a number of people (e.g. 25)
# During each 'trial' you do the following
#	Choose a person
#	Give them a random birthday
#	Store it in the calendar
# Once you have stored all birthdays, check to see if any have the same day
# Do this for many trials to see what the probability of sharing a birthday is
